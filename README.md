#Wikipedia Map
All geotagged Wikipedia articles on a single map (about 600,000 in English) using [https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet](Leaflet), [https://github.com/mourner/rbush](RBush) RTree library, and data from [http://dbpedia.org](DBPedia) [http://dbpedia.org/sparql](SPARQL endpoint) and [http://wiki.dbpedia.org/Downloads](dumps).

Static site ready to use. Data are on DBPedia dumps which seem to only be updated once a year, in June.

TODO:
    - Find other sources such as a geolocation services towns, counties and provinces
    - Maybe show two layers at a time?
    - Actual multilingual support
